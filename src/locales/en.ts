    content: `I'm a <strong>professional graphic designer</strong> and a <strong>front-end developer in progress</strong>. During the day, I work at a design agency where I create advertising campaigns, printed materials, social media assets, and creative copy — an experience that taught me to <strong>think strategically</strong> about every pixel and word. At night, I study Systems Analysis and Development at Fatec São José dos Campos - Prof. Jessen Vidal, and continue learning independently, diving into <strong>React and Tailwind CSS</strong> to turn creative ideas into functional interfaces.<br/><br/>
            My journey began in <strong>2017 with Photoshop</strong>, and was solidified through my technical course in IT, where I learned everything from <strong>OOP with Java</strong> to web development using <strong>PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. This dual background — hands-on design and technical programming — allows me to approach digital projects from two perspectives: <strong>user experience</strong> and <strong>code structure</strong>.<br/><br/>
            My goal is clear: to become a <strong>true hybrid professional</strong>, capable of leading projects that demand both <strong>impactful design</strong> and <strong>precise development</strong>. Whether designing a high-converting banner or building a component-based interface in React, I always aim to balance <strong>form and function</strong>.`,
