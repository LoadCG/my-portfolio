    content: `I'm an 18-year-old Brazilian developer passionate about merging <strong>code with creativity</strong>. My journey began in 2020 with basic IT courses, evolving into <strong>full-stack development</strong> through my technical education at Colégio Comercial de Caçapava, where I built systems in languages like Java, React and PHP/MySQL and designed UI prototypes in Figma.<br/><br/>What drives me is the <strong>problem-solving process</strong> - whether it's debugging a Java application or perfecting a design layout or flyer. My academic projects like the <link>Chrysalis E-commerce</link> (PHP/MySQL + Tailwind) taught me the value of <strong>end-to-end development</strong>.<br/><br/>While I'm pursuing my degree in Systems Analysis, I'm actively enhancing my <strong>front-end skills</strong> with React and exploring data fundamentals through <strong>Python Essentials</strong>. My 7-year Photoshop experience helps me create <strong>visually cohesive projects</strong> that balance functionality and aesthetics.`,
